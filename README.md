# Project description :

Decentralized Electronic Healthcare Records

HealthChain is a solution for collecting, storing, clustering data to ease access and use of medical records with respect to the privacy of the patient's personal details where a patient can access his medical records, share it with healthcare providers, and grant them permission to add a new set of data according to their status (pharmacist/ physicians....).
This data should be encrypted stored and secured in a decentralized database with permission access and guarantee the privacy of the personal information.
